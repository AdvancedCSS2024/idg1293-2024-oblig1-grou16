Task 1: 
We started marking up Finn.no main containers and the main components of the site. We drew important components like the navbar, search, listings, login page and other important components.
after we drew over the pages we stored the images under the document folder.

Task 2:
We searched Finn's website for BEM code and placed it inside the common.scss folder.  

Task 3: 
Task 3 was really fun. Each of us developed a site page-screenshot1.html and page-screenshot2.html. We started very simple and implemented the basic components like nav, search, forum and other basic tags. 
When we were done implementing the html we started with CSS. We used Finn's fabric design system which helped us alot designing the page with CSS. Inspect elements was also very helpful for designing the site.
We also used SCSS and shortened alot of the CSS by using the "&" symbol instead of writing nav many times. It was confusing at first but i think we got it in the end.

Task 4:
